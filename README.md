# Swara
Musical machine learning.

## Modules
- [ ] ```swara-assets/```: Pictures, data, and files
- [ ] ```swara-core/```: Core libraries (search, composition, etc.)
- [ ] ```swara-learn/```: Machine learning framework
- [x] ```swara-music/```: Musical data structures

## Roadmap
- Experiment with digital music.
- Implement machine learning algorithms from scratch (neural networks, markov chains, SVM, etc.).
- Create a [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/swara-labs) profile with completely computer generated content (music, album art, song titles, etc.).
